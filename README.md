Spring 2025

Daniel Fishkin / dfishkin@ramapo.edu / dfiction.com

<u>SYLLABUS IS SUBJECT TO REVISION DURING THE SEMESTER</u>

*Course Description:* This course provides a foundational introduction
to music programming languages. SuperCollider, Python, Processing and
Open Frameworks will be explored through hands-on and creative
applications. Students will gain experience with interactive visual art,
game design, audio/music signal processing, and machine learning. 

> This course does not provide a thorough introduction to any single
> computing language. Rather, it expects an encourages a humanistic
> approach translating higher level concepts of art to lower and very
> low levels of applications specific to your intent.

Course Instructor: Daniel Fishkin

*Lecture Time:* Wednesdays, 1:00 pm — 4:30 pm

*Lecture Location:* Electronic Music Lab, H-Wing 204 or occasionally
remote.

Software **Max**

> <https://cycling74.com/>
>
> Max is an object-oriented programming language that makes easy
> prototyping of sound environments/instruments accessible without
> needing to learn to code on levels like JS or C. It is a type of
> coding language in its own way, but the coding is done primarily with
> virtual representations of wires. It’s very fun and many of my class
> demos will get you excited about what’s possible—download it and see
> what you can get working off the bat! 
>
> *Note: you can try Max for free for 30 days, and thereafter you’ll
> need to purchase it, or sign up for a monthly or yearly student
> subscription. It is affordable. Conn College has Max on every machine
> in the computer lab!*
>
> **Max comes with an extensive body of educational materials,
> tutorials, help files, and project examples that can easily be
> copy/pasted into your own sketches.** <u>Students will be expected to
> read and study Max / MSP tutorials on their own and learn the syntax
> of the software throughout the course of the semester!</u>

> hard to work with.

P5js is the modern update of processing

**Sublime**

My favorite code editor! Simple, elegant, free.

Course Objectives:

● Production Techniques: evaluate and apply advanced techniques in music
production, synthesis, recording, programming, editing, and mastering;

● Theoretical Foundations: identify and interpret core theoretical
foundations of audio;

● Context: analyze and articulate the importance of context in diverse
practices within music technology;

● Musicianship and Production: integrate traditional, non-Western, and
experimental approaches to musicianship and composition with music
production skills;

● Collaboration: collaborate with others effectively and demonstrate
leadership in professional situations; and

● Innovation: recognize and formulate innovative approaches to music
technologies and careers.

**Course Goals**

● Understanding the relationship between computer programming, music,
and digital audio

● Developing core proficiencies relevant to algorithmic composition,
interface design, computer programming, analysis and signal processing

● Gaining the ability to read, write, and modify computer code related
to music.

**Measurable Student Learning Outcomes **

● Comprehend the importance of music programming in improvised and
notated contemporary music (Projects)

● Demonstrate the ability to create programs in SuperCollider, Python,
Processing and C++ in the production of compositions an performances
(Projects)

● Understand the fundamentals of computer programming languages for
music and be able to implement them to build original Audio Unit &
VSTplugins (Projects)

**Grading Rubric**

> Class Participation / Attendance 25%
>
> Etudes / Projects/ 25%
>
> Presentations 25%
>
> Final Project 25%

**Class Participation / Attendance 25%**

Class attendance is mandatory. We work and experiment in class.
Discussions, critiques lectures and demonstrations provide the basis for
the successful completion of projects, and they are difficult to
re-create outside of class. In order to participate, you must be in
attendance. You have one unexcused absence permitted for the semester.
Your final grade will drop by 6 points for each further unexcused
absence. More than three absences will result in a failing grade for the
course. You are expected to participate actively in class by asking
questions, bringing energy to discussions, and arriving with prepared
homework/projects. Independent motivation is expected.

**Etudes / Homework 25%**

Short reading assignments or creative prompts will be assigned each
week. Students will be expected to complete them and come to class ready
to discuss their progress. You cannot “get ahead” of these assignments
by doing them all ahead of time—or catch up!—they are meant to be part
of a weekly practice that is customized to the flow of the class.

**Artist Presentation 25%**

Do a short research presentation on an artist or piece of art that
inspires you. 10 min. The purpose of this assignment is to aid the
development of your final project by creating an opportunity to research
something that interests you for your own creative purposes and research
agenda.

**Final Project 25%**

Make a creative thesis and execute it. The project may include video,
audio, and may somehow utilize a computational process to illuminate
your corpus. You can use synthesis, sampling. You can also persue
something mentioned in class but not explicitly explored. You can write
code for the Flying Fish Board, for a Noise Toy, in Supercollider. You
are invited not to merely make a demo—Make a piece! I would even accept
a project in Max MSP. You can use your recorded corpus or create a new
one. Students may work collaboratively. The project must be proposed and
accepted by instructor. We may present these projects at the Tristan
Perich concert, on 12/11, pending feasibility and student interest.

**AI Policy**

The use of Machine Learning tools such as ChatGPT and Claude are
permitted, generally. In some cases we will explore them deliberately.
In some instances you will be discouraged from using these tools. AI
represents a sea change for humanity. It also represents a paradigm
shift for pedagogy in digital literacy.

I expect you will want to use AI (ChatGPT and image generation tools, at
a minimum), in this class. In fact, some assignments will require it.
Learning to use AI is an emerging skill—be aware of its limits. If you
provide minimum effort prompts, you will get low quality results. You
will need to refine your prompts in order to get good outcomes. This
will take work.

Don’t trust any code that your AI provides you. You will be responsible
for any errors or omissions provided by the tool. AI is a tool, but one
that you need to acknowledge using. Please include a paragraph or
citation on any assignment that uses AI explaining what you used the AI
for and what prompts you used to get the results. Failure to do so is in
violation of the academic honesty policies.
